    manifesto: Mozilla Manifesto
    desc: Mozilla cares about the privacy of all internet users. This is based on our manifesto. After multiple privacy initiatives in the US, India, France and Germany, it's time to take a stand against the planned intelligence service law reform. The Swiss Mozilla community therefore asks every internet user to inform yourself about the upcoming vote which probably will happen in September 2016. You can find more information on the websites below (unfortunately the information is only available in German and French).
